## Running `Claim Amount Exploratory.ipynb`

You will need to either do a local import of the `insurance.csv` file. I.e. have the file on your computer and import it from there. 

Or you could upload the file into Watson Studio (into an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage) and then click on `Import to notebook`
and pick the `insurance.csv` file. After that, running the 
first cell should work successfully.
